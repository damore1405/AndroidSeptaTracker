Same as Ios Version... but in android

So, I had this already set up for android. It was a project that i had to do for an intro to app programming course. However, 
becasue it was an assignment, the code was a lil messy and just "worked" so when i started the new IOS verison, i decided to also redo the android version.
Didnt get very far with it, because I became more interested in the iOS and Objective-C ecosystem
